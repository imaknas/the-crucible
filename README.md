# The Crucible ⚔️

**A multi-model AI arena for non-linear debate, deliberation, and consensus.**

The Crucible is an open-source, full-stack research interface that lets you orchestrate conversations across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models — simultaneously. Unlike traditional linear chat apps, every conversation is a **tree**: you can branch, rewind, pit models against each other, and synthesize their best ideas into a unified thesis.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **🌳 Conversation Trees** | Every message is a node. Branch off any point, explore alternate timelines, and navigate visually via a React Flow canvas. |
| **⚔️ Arena Mode** | Select multiple models and fire a single prompt. Each model responds in parallel, creating side-by-side branches for instant comparison. |
| **⚖️ Deliberation** | Invite a different model to critically review an existing conversation thread — with full speaker attribution so it knows who said what. |
| **🤝 Consensus Engine** | Select divergent responses and synthesize them into a single, cohesive academic brief. |
| **🧠 Smart Compression** | Automatic context management via `tiktoken`. When token counts approach a model's limit, older history is compressed into a technical brief — with speaker attribution preserved. |
| **📐 LaTeX Math** | Native rendering of `$inline$` and `$$block$$` math expressions via KaTeX. |
| **🕐 Temporal Context** | Models automatically receive the current date, time, and timezone — just like official web clients. |
| **📎 Document Attachments** | Upload PDFs mid-conversation. Documents are embedded directly into the message, not stored globally. |

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Stack |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16, React, MUI, React Flow, Framer Motion, react-markdown, KaTeX |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain, SQLite, WebSockets, tiktoken |
| **AI Providers** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (via `langchain-*` SDKs) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 24+
- **Python** 3.12+
- **uv** (recommended) or pip
- At least one API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-crucible.git
cd the-crucible

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and add your API keys

# 3. Backend
cd backend
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
cd ..

# 4. Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..

# 5. Launch everything
chmod +x start_dev.sh
./start_dev.sh
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and step into The Crucible.

> **Tip:** `start_dev.sh` starts both the FastAPI backend (port 8000) and Next.js frontend (port 3000) in a single terminal. Press `Ctrl+C` to shut down both.

### Manual Start (if you prefer)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd backend && uv run python main.py

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 🐳 Run with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the entire stack is using Docker Compose.

1. **Configure environment**: 
   Ensure `backend/.env` exists with your keys.
2. **Launch**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. **Access**:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

> **Note:** The SQLite database is persisted in a Docker volume named `crucible_data`.

## 🛠️ Choosing Your Environment

| Method | Recommended For | Perks |
|---|---|---|
| **`./start_dev.sh`** | **Active Development** | Hot reloading, fast startup, easy debugging. |
| **`docker compose`** | **Evaluation & Deployment** | Zero-config env, high stability, exact production parity. |

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | At least one | OpenAI API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | At least one | Anthropic API key |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | At least one | Google AI API key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | No | Backend URL (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`) |

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```
